# My Personal Project

## Introduction

For my personal project, I intend to make a **Fantasy Soccer Application**. This project idea was of interest to me 
because for the last five years I have actively played *Fantasy Premier League*; an online points-based Fantasy sports
game based on the *English Premier League*. I developed quite a passion for it over time after consistently finishing
in the top 2% of players globally amongst an estimated 11 million. Moreover, there was a proposal in world football 
regarding a "super league", which combined Europe's top soccer teams all into one league, which created major
controversy amongst Soccer fans, this application will essentially highlight what it would look like if the
"Super League" was actually created.

## Functionality
The application have a preloaded set of top Soccer players across Europe's top five leagues. The user will be able to 
add players into their team, constrained by a maximum number of players per team, and maximum number of players per
position (Defense, Midfield, Attack). The positive points that the players accumulate is based on statistics such as:
- Goals
- Assists
- Clean sheets 
- minutes played

Whilst point deduction statistics would be 
- Yellow cards
- Red cards
- Fouls
- Own goals
- Penalty misses

The user adds their desired players into their team, and the stats for each game-week are updated based on the
aforementioned statistics, and a game-week points is generated for  the users team. For example, allocating 3 points
for a goal, 2 points for an assist, a users players scores 2 goals and gets 1 assist, therefore accumulates 8 points
for that game-week.
